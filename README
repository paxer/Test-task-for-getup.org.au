THE PROBLEM:
Write a Rails app providing a simple form which allows users to enter
rules based on where people live and which email provider they use, 
then display a list of names which match these criteria.



GUIDELINES:
Only needs a very basic UI - no fancy CSS.
To save time do not use any javascript.
You are welcome to use any gems and plugins that you feel will assist.
Bonus points for providing a link to a GitHub repo and your app running on Heroku.
We like tests.
